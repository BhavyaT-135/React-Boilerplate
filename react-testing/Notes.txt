Why you should test?
* Goal - Check whether an application behaves as expected
* Safeguard against unwanted behaviour when changes are made to the code
* Automated, and thus efficient on the long-term

What should you test?
* Have a test priority (example):

1. High value features
2. Edge cases in high value features
3. Things that are easy to break
4. Basic React component Testing
    * User interactions
    * Conditional rendering
    * Utils/Hooks
